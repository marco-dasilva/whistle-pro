      <h2>Burlington Soccer Group Rules - Updated January 2019</h2>
      <p>
        * Only Group Admins can start the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        * The list for the next Tuesday game only can be started after current Tuesday game. It is the same idea for other weekdays if they exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        * The name of the group will be changed to display the info for the next game.
      </p>
      <p>
        * Usually, the gym 1h game is $5 per player. And the turf 1h game is around $10 per player in Spring/Summer season and $12 in Fall/Winter season.
      </p>
      <p>
        * If we decided to play GYM, the list starts with 12 spots available. However, if we get the exact 15 players, we will play gym with three teams. Usually FALL / WINTER.
      </p>
      <p>
        * If we decided to play INDOOR TURF, the list starts with 16 spots. If we have 14 or more players, we can play 1 hr indoor turf. If we have between 16 and 21 players, we can book 1:30 hrs instead. If we have 28 players, we can book two fields of 1 hr and play a 4-team tournament with 3 games of 18 minutes for each team. Usually SPRING / SUMMER.
      </p>
      <p>
        * 4-Teams Tournament Rules:
        <ul>
          <li>All teams will play 3 games. All against all.</li>
          <li>Every 5 minutes goalies change.</li>
          <li>Players not wearing the right shirt color can only play as a goalie.</li>
          <li>Fair play is the soul of the event. Lets the involved players decided if there is a call or not. The closer players can help to decide. Avoid calling fault/freekick far from the situation.</li>
          <li>First game ends at 10:18 PM</li>
          <li>Second game ends at 10:38 PM</li>
          <li>The final round will finish at the OSC ending bell.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        * The list is a first-come-first-serve list.
      </p>
      <p>
        * Only players on the list will be playing next game. All players on the WAITING LIST will not play unless there is any cancelation.
      </p>
      <p>
        * Each one that needs to remove your name from the list, before the game, has to promote the first player on the waiting list to your place on the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        * If there are no players on the waiting list at the cancelation moment and no one joins the list to complete the roster, that player has to pay for his spot even if he is not playing, double the fee if it's a 28 player game, unless it's a medical or family emergency (the reason being that one team short of a player unbalances the whole tournament).
      </p>
      <p>
        * If a player drops off 30 min or less before the start of the game, the first player to say he is able to go will get the spot (instead of the next in the list).
      </p>
      <p>
        * Any individual cases can be considered by the group founders.
      </p>
